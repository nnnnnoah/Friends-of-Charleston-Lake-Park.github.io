              <h3>Trail Monitoring Programme</h3>
              <p>
                We need volunteers to help maintain and develop our trail
                system.
              </p>
              <p>
                What does it mean? Well, it's pretty easy. You would sign up for
                a specific month on one trail. (For a list of the trails, see
                the Our Park section of this website) Trails vary in length from
                1 to 10 km, easy to difficult rating. You would walk your trail
                twice a month, either alone or with another monitor, trimming
                back small brush and reporting larger problems to Park staff.
                Working with other Friends and Park staff, you would walk your
                trail on a regular basis, check out for fallen branches, clear
                off debris, reporting on maintenance problems to the Park staff.
                You would be expected top pick up garbage and report larger
                problems. Often you will meet other walkers who may need help or
                who will just thank you for the work you are doing. This all
                makes a difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trail monitors receive special training from Park staff before
                they can begin their work. The scope of the work of being a
                Trail Monitor is limited to cleaning, setting out trail markers
                and minor clearance of brush on the trail. Another vital part is
                locating major problems, but reporting them to the Park staff
                through our reporting system, which is completely electronic and
                very effective. We have a Trail Master who gets us organized so
                that all trails are covered and who monitors the reports.
              </p>
              <p>
                You also have to sign a volunteer agreement with the Park, which
                is a necessary formality to ensure you are protected. It also
                gives you access to the Park when you are monitoring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Contact us if you would like to volunteer and become a Trail
                Monitor for the Friends!

                We are always eager to have more people involved. Board members
                serve on an annual basis and there are the usual jobs that need
                doing for an organization like ours.
