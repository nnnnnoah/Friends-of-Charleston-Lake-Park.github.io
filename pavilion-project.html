                    <p>
                        In conjunction with this, the park has recently announced an expansion of its area. More campsites will be strategically placed,
                        and more land will be conserved for the enjoyment of our community and the protection of all species. Over the past 30 years, the
                        Friends of Charleston Lake Park (FCLP) has hosted many park events. We've talked about the need for a permanent covered structure
                        of an adequate size. Extreme summer heat and heavy rains affect the success of the events we plan for the community and for the campers.
                        For example, for seven years, the Friends have hosted a September Seniors Day for the community complete with lunch. Weather conditions have
                        run the gamut from sunny and hot to soaked-to-the-skin downpours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The importance of a permanent pavilion at Charleston Lake Park is clear. We want to put the talk of a covered gathering space into action. For this we need your help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our wheelchair accessible pavilion will be 26 x 42 feet (approximately 7 x 12 metres), with a concrete floor and one closed wall for video/computer presentations.
                        It will be used for park and community gatherings with a focus on park-specific education, workshops and entertainment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The total project is estimated at $150,000 and will be refined once specs are finalized and quotes have been solicited. Funding will be a combination of donations,
                        grants and services in-kind from park staff. The completion date is estimated as Fall/Winter 2025-26. To be considered for a grant, FCLP must provide 25% of the total
                        cost of the structure. We are a registered charitable organization with limited funds. This is beyond our means.
                    </p>
