                    <p>Charleston Lake possesses a captivating feature: it is nestled within two distinct types of
                        bedrock, granite and sandstone. This unique characteristic not only shapes the physical
                        attributes and ecology of the lake but also influences its history and land utilization. The
                        southwestern end of the watershed mainly rests on igneous bedrock, while the northeastern
                        portion sits on sedimentary rock. As a watershed, the region is almost evenly divided between
                        these two bedrock types.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/sandstone_overhang.jpg" class="img-border sandstone-img visible-xs center-block"
                        alt="The Overhang on Sandstone Trail">
                    <p>Towards the southwest, Charleston Lake stretches across the valleys of ancient metamorphic
                        bedrock known as the Grenville Province, which belongs to the youngest plate of the Precambrian
                        Canadian Shield. This granite, gneiss, and schist bedrock formed nearly a billion years ago when
                        shifting tectonic plates collided, resulting in the creation of vast mountain ranges. Over
                        millions of years, the softer rock of the mountain peaks eroded away, leaving behind only the
                        enduring rock that cradles the lake today. The lake's shape is molded by the slopes and valleys
                        of these ancient mountain roots. Although glaciers have shaped the old valleys over millennia,
                        the topography remains reminiscent of its ancient past.
                    </p>
                    <p>The northeastern watershed predominantly consists of softer, layered sedimentary bedrock. These
                        sandstones were formed from weathered particles deposited in shallow seas that once covered vast
                        regions in the distant past. These sandstones primarily consist of weathered particles carried
                        to the seas, along with some fossilized remains of primitive life forms from that time.</p>
                    <p>This softer rock, dating back approximately 500 million years, has not endured as resolutely as
                        the harder granites. Climate variations and numerous glaciations have eroded much of it away.
                        Nonetheless, pockets of sandstone can still be found in and around Charleston Lake.</p>
                    <p>The contrasting characteristics and chemistry of these two bedrock types contribute significantly
                        to the diversity of the region's ecology and history. Plants and wildlife have adapted to thrive
                        on either one of these bedrock types, but where the two types meet, additional diversity
                        emerges. Land use patterns differ greatly between the two bedrocks. On shield-type rock, roads
                        and waterways meander through valleys among the hills. Settlements strategically developed near
                        waterfalls and transportation routes on the shield. On the flatter lands of the sedimentary
                        plains, settlements were less restricted. Farms on the shield were organized in patterns
                        resembling clay basins within granite outcrops, while on the flat plains, farms could be
                        sectioned and fenced into neat rectangles.</p>
                    <p>Within this watershed, the majority of the Charleston Lake area itself lies on granite bedrock,
                        which has resulted in relatively limited development. Upstream in the watershed, on the more
                        level sedimentary plains, considerably more land has been cleared for forestry and agriculture,
                        and much of it has remained cleared.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt40">The Ecological Setting</h3>
                    <p>In broad terms, the forest region is part of the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Lowlands Forest
                        Region. However, a closer examination reveals an intricately complex ecology. The Biosphere
                        Reserve serves as a unique intersection point for almost all the forest regions of eastern North
                        America. It sits at the crossroads of landforms, where the ancient Canadian Shield extends
                        southward to the Adirondack Mountains in an hourglass-shaped formation known as the Frontenac
                        Arch. This geological feature is flanked by much younger layered sedimentary rock plains. The
                        St. Lawrence River, cutting through the Arch, connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic coast.
                        These landforms, along with the river, have acted as corridors for both short and long-term
                        migration of plants and animals.</p>
                    <p>Plants and animals from various regions such as the boreal northland, the Atlantic coast, the
                        continental heartland, the Appalachian Mountains, and the Carolinian south migrate through these
                        landform corridors, resulting in interactions and intermingling. Consequently, the biological
                        diversity and ecological richness in our park are astonishing. Not only does the park boast a
                        large number of species, ranking among the top three in Canada, but the geographical ranges of
                        these species are also extraordinary.</p>
                    <p>The climate, influenced by the Great Lakes, combined with a wide range of soil and rock types and
                        chemistries, diverse topography of hills, cliffs, and valleys, and varied land uses, create an
                        immensely complex physical landscape. This complexity allows for a tremendous variety of
                        habitats and niches to exist, providing opportunities for numerous plants and animals to thrive,
                        having migrated from different parts of eastern North America.</p>
                    <p>One of the remarkable aspects of this biodiversity is that many of the plants and animals in this
                        area are at or near the limits of their natural ranges. For example, the three-needled Pitch
                        Pine, commonly found in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, is only found in this particular region of
                        Canada. The same can be said for the Eastern Rat Snake, which is the largest snake in the area.
                    </p>
                    <p>Red spruce and wire birch are typical trees in Atlantic coast forests, reaching this far west.
                        Balsam fir, sweet gale, and barren grounds strawberry are boreal forest plants with southern
                        range extensions into our area. This complexity in species distribution contributes to the
                        richness of the landscape.</p>
                    <p>It is not surprising that due to the intermixing of numerous species at or near the ends of their
                        extended ranges, the park is home to a high proportion of species designated as rare,
                        threatened, and endangered. While we frequently hear about dire situations for various plants
                        and animals worldwide, we need only look to our own forests and wetlands to find species that
                        face equally precarious circumstances. Currently, there are 32 Species at Risk in the region,
                        one of the highest numbers in Canada, indicating the richness of the landscape. These species
                        often depend on very specific habitat conditions, and as habitats are compromised, these species
                        may disappear from the area and potentially even the entire region. Our stewardship of habitats,
                        no matter how small, can make a significant difference in preserving the continued diversity of
                        this internationally recognized ecology.</p>
                    <p>The development of our forests into their present-day character began approximately 3,000 years
                        ago. Before that time, forests were transitioning through various types as the continent
                        adjusted to the climate changes following the last ice age.</p>
                    <p>Sugar maple, beech, paper birch, hemlock, red oak, and white pine are the most abundant tree
                        species, while basswood, red maple, white ash, shagbark hickory, white oak, red pine, and
                        ironwood are also quite prevalent. West-facing points of land and exposed granite ridge tops
                        host species that can withstand the dry and windy conditions. Ground covers consist of
                        blueberries, sedges, and tufts of moss growing on the thin, coarse soil, while pitch pine, June
                        berry, and red oak tower above.</p>
                    <p>Broader valleys between the ridges often contain pockets of clay left from ancient post-glacial
                        lake bottoms. In these areas, deep-rooted trees such as sugar maple, American beech, Canadian
                        yew, and shagbark hickory cast deep shade over carpets of trilliums, dogtooth violets,
                        gooseberry, and numerous other shrubs and wildflowers. Steeper north-facing slopes are cool and
                        damp, providing ideal conditions for stands of hemlock, striped maple, elderberry, and polypody
                        ferns. Broad ridges with shallower soil and occasional rock outcrops host savannahs of white
                        oak, white pine, ironwood, coarse sedges, grasses, and various fern species. Additionally, there
                        are several other community types present.
                    </p>
                    <p>Alvars, characterized by shallow soils on sedimentary bedrock, along with extreme temperature and
                        wet and dry conditions, are globally rare habitats found only around the Baltic Sea and the
                        Great Lakes. However, they make up nearly 8% of the watershed's habitat types and can be found
                        on the islands and shorelines of Charleston Lake. The waterways, each with their own unique
                        variations of depth, bottom type, currents, and slopes, contribute to the vast array of wetland
                        and aquatic habitats. As a result, the lake itself exhibits surprising diversity, including a
                        variety of coldwater, coolwater, and warmwater fish species.</p>
                    <p>When this region was first settled by immigrants, the habitats were very similar to what we
                        observe today. However, the size of trees in those ancient forests was often enormous. As the
                        land was cleared, new habitats such as fields and subsequently abandoned fields created
                        opportunities for new plant and animal species. At the same time, habitat for some species was
                        significantly reduced. The impact on animal life was particularly pronounced, with timber
                        wolves, moose, woodland elk, eastern cougar, black bear, lynx, and martin among those unable to
                        survive in the more limited and fragmented habitats. On the other hand, eastern cottontail
                        rabbits and coyotes expanded their ranges into the region, while whitetail deer and raccoons
                        thrived. Interestingly, as some forests age and abandoned fields return to forested areas, there
                        are occasional sightings of some of the former wilderness residents.</p>
                    <p>There is still much to learn about the animal species in the area, as smaller animals, including
                        reptiles and amphibians, have not been thoroughly surveyed or studied to understand their
                        presence and populations. Furthermore, landscape connections and potential reconnections may
                        result in increased success for wildlife in this region. This is one of the reasons why the
                        Friends have invested their funds and sought funding to study species in the park. With such
                        great diversity, there are still many unknowns to discover. </p>

                    <h3 class="mt40">Flora & Fauna</h3>
                    <p>Charleston Lake Provincial Park boasts a rich diversity of plant and animal species. This
                        diversity can be attributed to the park's unique combination of a northern geological landscape
                        and its southern location with a warmer climate. As a result, the park showcases a fascinating
                        mix of northern species, such as Black Spruce and Pitcher Plant, and southern species, including
                        Pitch Pine and Shagbark Hickory. The park serves as a sanctuary for nine species at risk,
                        including the Black Ratsnake, Red-shouldered Hawk, and the Southern Flying Squirrel. Visitors to
                        the park can encounter thirty-five species of mammals, including Beaver, White-tailed Deer,
                        Fisher, and Mink. Charleston Lake is renowned for its abundant reptiles and amphibians, with
                        Northern Map Turtles and Eastern Ribbonsnakes commonly spotted by park visitors. Birdwatchers
                        will be captivated by intriguing bird species like Cerulean and Golden-winged Warblers, as well
                        as Yellow-billed and Black-billed Cuckoos.
