                    <p>Charleston Lake has the interesting distinction of being cradled in two distinct bedrock types:
                        granite and sandstone. This feature has not only determined the physical shape and
                        characteristics of the lake and its ecology, but has shaped the course of its history and land
                        use as well. For the most part, the southwest end of the watershed is on igneous bedrock and the
                        northeast portion is on sedimentary rock. As a watershed, the region is nearly equally split
                        between the two bedrock types.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/sandstone_overhang.jpg" class="img-border sandstone-img visible-xs center-block"
                        alt="The Overhang on Sandstone Trail">
                    <p>Charleston Lake, towards the southwest, sprawls through the valleys of the ancient metamorphic
                        bedrock of the youngest plate of the Precambrian Canadian Shield, known as the Grenville
                        Province. This granite and gneiss and schist bedrock dates to nearly a billion years ago, when
                        shifting plates of the earth's crust collided and pushed an enormous range of mountains into
                        existence. Over hundreds of millions of years, the softer rock of the mountain peaks weathered
                        away, leaving only the “roots” of the mountains; the durable rock cradling the lake today. The
                        northeast-southwest trend of the ridges and valleys belies the orientation of the long-eroded
                        mountains. The shape of the lake is molded by the pattern of the slopes and valleys of the old
                        mountain roots. While glaciers gouged and rounded and deepened and broadened the old valleys
                        over millennia, the topography today is not unlike that of hundreds of millions of years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>The softer, layered bedrock found in most of the northeastern watershed are sedimentary forms, or
                        those that formed originally as weathered particles in shallow seas which flooded vast regions
                        long ago. These sandstones consist mostly of weathered particles carried to the seas, but as
                        well some fossilized bodies of the very primitive life-forms of the times.</p>
                    <p>Dating to something approaching 500 million years ago, this softer rock has not endured so
                        resolutely as the harder granites, and the vagaries of climate and numerous glaciations have
                        worn much away. Even so, there are patches of sandstone around and in Charleston Lake.</p>
                    <p>The characteristics and chemistry of the two bedrock types are quite different, and so their
                        presence together significantly lends to the diversity of ecology, and history too. Plants and
                        wildlife are adapted to live best on one type or the other, but when the two bedrock types
                        border each other, there is additional diversity along the border. Land use patterns as we
                        recognize them are quite different on the contrasting bedrocks. On the shield type rock, roads,
                        like waterways, meander in valleys among the hills. Settlements arose strategically at falls of
                        water and transportation routes on the shield, but were less confined on the flatter lands of
                        the sedimentary plains. Shield farms were patterned on that of clay basins in the granite
                        outcrops, where on the flat plains, farm properties could be sectioned and fenced into neat
                        rectangles.</p>
                    <p>In this watershed, the much of the Charleston Lake area itself is in the granite bedrock, and
                        substantial development in large measure passed it by. Upstream in the watershed, on the more
                        level sedimentary plains, considerably more land was cleared in forestry and in great measure
                        remained cleared for agriculture and community.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt40">The Ecological Setting</h3>
                    <p>In broad terms, the forest region is part of the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Lowlands Forest
                        Region. A closer view, though, shows an ecology that is extremely complex. Almost all of the
                        forest regions of eastern North America intersect in the Biosphere Reserve, at a unique
                        crossroads of landforms. Here, the ancient Canadian Shield reaches deeply south to the
                        Adirondack Mountains in an hourglass-shaped formation called the Frontenac Arch, flanked by the
                        far younger plains of layered sedimentary rocks. Slashing across the Arch is the St. Lawrence
                        River, connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic coast. The Arch and river landforms became
                        corridors for the short and long-term migration of plants and animals.</p>
                    <p>Plants and animals of the boreal northland, the Atlantic coast, the continental heartland, the
                        Appalachian mountains and the Carolinian south migrate those landform corridors, and interact
                        and intermingle here. As a result, the diversity of our biology, our ecology in our Park, is
                        astounding. Not only are the simple numbers of species large here, in the top three in Canada,
                        but the diversity in terms of the geographical ranges of these species is extraordinary.</p>
                    <p>A climate modified by the Great Lakes, a broad range of soil and rock types and chemistries, a
                        diverse topography of hills, cliffs and valleys, and a range of land uses create a hugely
                        complex physical landscape. This allows a tremendous number of habitats and niches to exist
                        here, and in turn there are opportunities and the conditions for the multitude of plants and
                        animals that have populated the area from so many other parts of eastern North America.</p>
                    <p>The highlight of this biodiversity is that a goodly number of the plants and animals here are at
                        or near their natural range limits. For example, almost all of the three-needled Pitch Pine,
                        common on the New Jersey Pine Barrens, is found only in this region of Canada. The same is said
                        of our largest snake, the eastern rat snake (formerly called the black rat snake).</p>
                    <p>Red spruce and wire birch are typical trees in Atlantic coast forests, and reach inland just this
                        far west. Balsam fir, sweet gale and barren grounds strawberry are boreal forest plants that
                        have southern range extensions into our area. There are complexity here.</p>
                    <p>It is not surprising that because so many species are intermixed and near the ends of their
                        extended ranges, the Park hosts a high proportion of species that are designated rare,
                        threatened and endangered. While we hear every day about dire situations for numerous plants and
                        animals around the globe, we need look no further than our own forests and wetlands for species
                        that are equally precarious. At present, there are 32 Species at Risk in the region; a number
                        that while one of the highest in Canada shows the richness of the landscape. These sometimes
                        rely on very precise conditions for their habitat, and as habitats are compromised, species may
                        be lost from that location, and from the region itself. Our stewardship of habitats, however
                        small, can make a considerable difference in the continued diversity of this world recognized
                        ecology.</p>
                    <p>Our forests began developing the character we see today about 3,000 years ago. Prior to that
                        time, the forests were evolving through successions of forest types as the continent adjusted to
                        the climate changes following the last ice age.</p>
                    <p>Sugar maple, beech, paper birch, hemlock, red oak and white pine are most numerous, with
                        basswood, red maple, white ash, shagbark hickory, white oak, red pine and ironwood being quite
                        abundant as well. West-facing points of land and exposed granite ridge tops host species that
                        tolerate the dry and windy conditions. Ground covers of blueberries, sedges and tufts of moss
                        grow on the thin, coarse soil, with pitch pine, June berry and red oak overhead.</p>
                    <p>Broader valleys between the ridges often cradle deeper pockets of clay, left from the old
                        post-glacial lake bottoms. Here, deep-rooted trees such as sugar maple, American beech, Canadian
                        yew and shagbark hickory cast deep shade over carpets of trilliums, dogtooth violets, gooseberry
                        and myriads of other shrubs and wildflowers. Steeper northfacing slopes are cool and damp,
                        favouring stands of hemlock, striped maple, elderberry and polypody ferns. Broad ridges with
                        shallower soil, and often with rock outcrops, host savannahs of white oak, white pine, ironwood,
                        coarse sedges and grasses and many fern species. There are several other community types as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>Alvars—characterized by shallow soils on sedimentary bedrock, with extremes of temperature and
                        wet and dry conditions—are a globally rare habitat found only around the Baltic Sea and Great
                        Lakes, but are nearly 8% of the watershed's habitat types and are found on the lake's islands
                        and shorelines. The waterways, all with their own complex variations of depth, bottom type,
                        currents and slopelend to the vast array of wetland and aquatic habitats. Therefore, the lake
                        too has surprising diversity. The fish community, for example, has a variety of coldwater,
                        coolwater and warmwater fish species.
                        At the time this region was first settled by immigrants, the array of habitats was very similar
                        to those of today.
                    </p>
                    <p>The size of trees in those ancient forests, though, were often immense. When the land was
                        cleared, new elements of habitat, such as fields and then old, abandoned fields, made
                        opportunities to new species of both plants and animals. At the same time, though, habitat for
                        some species was substantially reduced. Animal life was perhaps most affected. Timber wolves,
                        moose, woodland elk, eastern cougar, black bear, lynx and martin were among those that could not
                        survive the more limited and fragmented habitats. On the other hand, eastern cottontail rabbits
                        and coyotes expanded their ranges to the region, and whitetail deer and raccoons thrived.
                        Interestingly, as some of the forests age and abandoned fields reforest themselves, there are
                        again occasional sightings of some of the former wilderness residents. </p>
                    <p>There is much to be learned about animal species here, as some of the smaller animals, including
                        reptiles and amphibians, have not been surveyed or studied sufficiently to understand their
                        presence and populations, as well, there are landscape connections and potential for
                        reconnections that may actually see wildlife become more successful in living here. This is one
                        reason that the Friends have invested their funds and sought out funding to study species at the
                        Park. In some respects, with this great diversity, we do not know what we do not know.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt40">Flora & Fauna</h3>
                    <p>Charleston Lake Provincial Park contains a rich diversity of plant and animal species. This high
                        diversity is due in large part to the Park’s mix of a northern geological landscape, and its
                        southern location and warmer climate. The result is an intriguing blend of both northern
                        species, such as Black Spruce and Pitcher Plant, and southern species, like Pitch Pine and
                        Shagbark Hickory. The park is sanctuary to 9 species at risk, including the Black Ratsnake,
                        Red-shouldered Hawk and the Southern Flying Squirrel. Thirty-five species of mammals can be
                        found in the park, such as Beaver, White-tailed Deer, Fisher and Mink. Charleston Lake is known
                        for its high diversity of reptiles and amphibians, with Northern Map Turtles and Eastern
                        Ribbonsnakes being commonly seen by park visitors. Intriguing birds such as Cerulean and
                        Golden-winged Warblers and Yellow-billed and Black-billed Cuckoos are sure to catch the
                        attention of many birdwatchers.</p>
